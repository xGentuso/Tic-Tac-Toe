# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a classic game played on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to get three of your own symbols (either X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Rules

1. The game is played by two players, usually referred to as Player 1 and Player 2.
2. Player 1 starts the game by placing their symbol (X) on an empty cell of the grid.
3. Player 2 then takes their turn and places their symbol (O) on an empty cell.
4. Players take turns until one of them gets three of their symbols in a row or all cells are filled.
5. If a player gets three of their symbols in a row, they win the game.
6. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Getting Started

To play the game, you will need a 3x3 grid and two players. Each player will take turns placing their symbol on an empty cell of the grid. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row wins the game.
